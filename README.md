## 4.1 Choosing an Operating System (weight: 1)
**Weight:** 1  

**Description:**  
Knowledge of major operating systems and Linux distributions.

**Notes:**  
- 🐧 **Linux:** Open-source, many distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS). Highly configurable, CLI and GUI support, used in servers, embedded systems, and cloud environments.  
- 🪟 **Windows:** Proprietary, GUI-focused, uses registry and .exe programs. Popular on desktops and enterprise environments.  
- 🍎 **macOS (OS X):** Unix-based, GUI-focused, proprietary, uses `.app` packages, common in design and development.  
- 🔄 **Distribution life cycle:**  
  - Alpha: Early testing, unstable.  
  - Beta: Pre-release, more stable but may have bugs.  
  - Stable: Fully tested, recommended for production.  
  - Rolling releases: Continuous updates without major versions (e.g., Arch Linux).  
- 💻 **CLI vs GUI:** CLI essential for Linux administration; GUI is optional but useful for desktops. GUI varies by desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE).  

**Partial List of Key Knowledge (in order):**
- 🖥️ **GUI versus command line** — CLI: faster, scriptable, essential for sysadmin; GUI: optional, easier for beginners.  
- 🎨 **Desktop configuration** — GNOME, KDE, XFCE; adjust themes, panels, shortcuts.  
- 🛠️ **Maintenance cycles** — Patch management, security updates, version upgrades.  
- 🧪 **Beta and stable** — Beta for testing new features; stable for production reliability.  

**Commands / Practice:**  
- `uname -a` — View kernel, OS type, version 🖥️  
- `ls`, `pwd`, `cd` — Navigate directories 📂  
- `cat /etc/os-release` — Check Linux distribution and version 🐧  
- Explore CLI and GUI interfaces 💻
